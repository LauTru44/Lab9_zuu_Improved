/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.

/* PART 1
 * 1)
 * - It's a game/text simulation that takes you to different rooms in a an university
 * - help, quit, go
 * - help, tells you the possible commands
 *   quit, stops the game
 *   go, it takes you to the doom that you decide to go to
 * - There's 4 rooms
 * PART 2
 * 19) it suggests to divide the program in three parts:
 * - model: manages the data and rules to follow
 * - controller: connects the model and view, processes user input.
 * - view: its the interface shown to the user. 
 * 
 * 21) The information should be present as text, the class game
 * has the string describing the item when initialized, the class 
 * prints it, but the method getlongdescription in class room returns it
 * It's suppose to work since whe did something similar with them room objects before.
 * 
 * 22) I added a hashmap to contain multiple items of a room
 * 
 * 23) I added the command back and the method goback
 * 
 * 24) It works at expected,if I type "back" and I am in the lab and then the
 * office, the player never returns to the outside, theres a loop between lab and office.
 * 
 * 25) It doesnt follow the original path taken, it can create a loop between rooms.
 * 
 * 26) A stack in Java is like a pile of plates, you can only add or remove the top plate.
 * 
 * PART 3
 * 27) player movement between rooms, right exits and interaction functionality.
 * 28) Creation of the player class.
 * 
 * 29) implemented take and drop commands
 * 30-33) working on it
 *
